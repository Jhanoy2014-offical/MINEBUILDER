So basically, MINEBUILDER is a clone of minecraft fully written in HTML and JavaScript 
The latest version so far is beta 1.4 
BTW, there are few missing features such as multiplayer, survival mode and different diificultys
but it runs at 60 fps on low end machines and theres a handfull of working features such as flying 
You dont need a mouse to play but it is recommended. Instead of mouse you use arrow keys

Controls

WASD = move

Arrow key/ mouse = look around

Space = jump

Double tap space = fly

I = inventory

1 to 10 = change inventory slots

Left click = Destroy block

Right click = place block

Enjoy :)
