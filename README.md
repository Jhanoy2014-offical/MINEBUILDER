So basically, MINEBUILDER is a clone of minecraft fully written in HTML
The latest version so far is beta 1.4 
BTW, there are few missing features such as multiplayer, survival mode and different diificultys
but it runs at 60 fps on low end machines and theres a handfull of working features such as flying, superflat, accurate terrain, trees and caves. 
You dont need a mouse to play but it is recommended. Instead of mouse you use arrow keys

Controls

WASD = move

Arrow keys/ mouse = look around

Space = jump

Double tap space = fly

E = inventory

1 to 10 = change inventory slots

Left click = Destroy block

Right click = place block

Enjoy :)

BTW, its called MINEBUILDER because you can Mine and you can build as this game is not intended to be a adventure game but a game where you can express your creativity and build what ever you want and all the blocks are in your inventory so crafting is not needed.
