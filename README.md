MINEBUILDER is a clone of infiniminer that is inspired by minecraft classic and infdev. Theres a handfull of features such as flying, superflat, accurate terrain, trees and caves and even with all that, it still runs at 60 fps on low end machines.

Controls

WASD = move

Arrow keys/ mouse = look around

Space = jump

Double tap space = fly

E = inventory

Q = Sprint

Shift = Crouch

1 to 10 = change inventory slots

Left click = Destroy block

Right click = place block

Enjoy :)

BTW, its called MINEBUILDER because you can Mine and you can build as this game is not intended to be a adventure game but a game where you can express your creativity and build what ever you want and all the blocks are in your inventory so crafting is not needed.
